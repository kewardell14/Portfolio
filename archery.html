                    This exercise focused on creating a logo for a hypothetical business, with a hypothetical audience and mascot of my
                    choosing. I selected an archery business with minors between the ages of 8-17 as my primary audience, and a hawk as my mascot.
                    This business will be focused on teaching young archers in a safe environment and providing specialized/custom gear for that may not be as readily available for minors.

                    The primary client would be the hypothetical owner of this business, but the audience would consist
                    mostly of potential archers between the age of 8-17.

        <p>
            I tried to focus on the symbolism of freedom shown through the imagery of an arrow and bird flying, contributing to the
            idea that those who learn through Minor Adjustments Archery will learn to soar. I chose the color orange as my main 
            color because I wanted to convey a sense of energy, while maintaining a feeling of safety that wouldn't come as easily from a red.
