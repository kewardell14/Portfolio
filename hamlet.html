          To celebrate the most influential authors and books of all time, the Library of Congress is hosting an exhibit
          that will
          feature historical artifacts, original manuscripts, 1st editions and other objects related to the authorship
          and
          original release of each text. The exhibit features a timeline of books, their respective artifacts, exhibits,
          and ends
          with “Looking Forward, Modern Interpretations of the Classic Covers” featuring 100 cover concepts for each of
          the 100
          books featured in the show. The idea is to use the book cover as a way to spark interest in and communicate
          something
          about each story in unique ways. To accomplish this last effort, the library is hiring teams of designers to
          contribute
          to the event. Create two different book covers featuring a play of your choice. One will be focused solely on
          using type, and the other focused on imagery.

        This design was constructed purely out of type. The fading effect serves a dual purpose as it alludes to the
        ghost of
        Hamlet's father, as well as the existential crisis that befalls Hamlet summarized in the classic line, "to be or
        not to be."

      <p>
        This design demonstrates the duality of Hamlet's behaviors as sane and insane. The king chess piece in the
        middle represents the metaphorical game of chess, wits, deceit, and manipulation that is experienced by
        characters in Hamlet, which lead consistently drive the plot forward.
