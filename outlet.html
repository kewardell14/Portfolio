                <h3>The Exhibit</h3>
                <p>
                    The Exhibit is a poem that focuses on the belief that God is an artist, with the world and everything in it as His masterpieces. 
                    The author, however, struggles to see beauty or divine craftsmanship in themselves, questioning their place in God's creation despite acknowledging His perfection as the Creator.
                    <br><br>
                    I chose to illustrate the subject's internal conflict in the poem by positioning them behind the poster, symbolizing their inability to perceive themselves as they are seen through God's eyes. The nature background was incorporated to
                    highlight the poem's emphasis on the inherent value of all of God's creations. Additionally, I selected a golden color
                    for the title to evoke a sense of divine light and purity, complementing the elegant frame and adding a harmonious
                    visual connection to the theme of spiritual worth.

                <h3>Feathers on the Sea</h3>
                <p>
                    Feathers On the Sea reflects on the myth of Icarus, exploring the tension between the pursuit of dreams and the
                    inevitable consequences of overreaching. It mourns his fall but also honors the fleeting freedom he experienced,
                    questioning if the cost of his ambition was worth the brief moment of flight.
                    <br><br>
                    I aimed to capture the duality of consequence and beauty inherent in the pursuit of dreams. The image of burning
                    feathers serves as a frozen moment in time, symbolizing Icarus's flight too close to the sun and the inevitable fallout.
                    The use of a fiery title ties the text to the image, reinforcing the intensity of the theme. To further reflect the
                    emotional balance of the story, I chose a turbulent sea to convey chaos and a clear sky to evoke tranquility,
                    illustrating the coexistence of both forces in the narrative's emotional landscape.

                <h3>On the Train Northward</h3>
                <p>
                    On The Train Northward tells about a young lady named Molly Martson, who, on a snowy night, boards a late train, clutching a worn violin case
                    tied to memories of her past. While keeping to herself, she encounters a mysterious green-eyed stranger whose intentions
                    seem unclear. During an unexpected delay, Molly finds solace in playing her brotherâ€™s violin under the watchful gaze of a snowy owl.
                    <br><br>
                    I integrated key symbols from the story, such as the owl, the initials on the violin, and the music that Molly creates
                    when the train stops, to strengthen the visual connection to the narrative. To unify these elements, I applied a faded
                    texture across the design, creating a sense of cohesion throughout. The use of red and black hues in the pull quotes
                    draws attention and adds emphasis, while the placement of these elements on each page helps to visually narrate the
                    progression of the story. This design approach deepens the connection between the text and the unfolding narrative,
                    enhancing the overall storytelling experience.

                <h3>Sunday Drive</h3>
                <p>
                    Sunday Drive focuses on the main characters, Wess and Pip, who deliver pizzas in a post-apocalyptic world filled with
                    danger from the undead. As they navigate through this chaotic landscape, their humorous banter and focus on completing
                    their job contrast with the ever-present threat of death, and their routine becomes a way to survive while maintaining a
                    semblance of normalcy.
                    <br><br>
                    I developed a cohesive design that reflects the playful creativity of the story while also acknowledging its darker
                    elements, such as the zombie piles. The pizza box elements symbolize the lighthearted nature of the narrative, while the
                    zombie piles introduce a more serious tone. To unify these contrasting aspects, I applied a consistent texture across
                    all elements, giving the design a worn, printed appearance that enhances the sense of authenticity and continuity
                    throughout.

                </section>
                <h3>The Weight of a Sole</h3>
                <p>
                    The Weight of a Sole reflects on the tragic and fleeting life of a ladybug, whose unexpected death under a human's foot
                    symbolizes the fragility and insignificance of life. It concludes with the author's personal connection to the bug's
                    fate, feeling similarly crushed by the weight of human existence.
                    <br><br>
                    I intentionally ripped the image on the left side to visually represent the theme of being crushed, symbolizing a person
                    broken by their environment. This element draws a parallel to the ladybug in the story, emphasizing the metaphor of
                    vulnerability and destruction. To further unify the design, I incorporated the cracked effect into the title and pull
                    quotes, creating a cohesive visual that reinforces the narrative's emotional depth and strengthens the overall
                    composition.

                <h3>Gallery Introduction and Spread</h3>
                <p>
                    As my role as one of the Gallery Directors, I continued to build on our established theme by incorporating a variety of
                    elements to create a dynamic collage for the Gallery Intro. This collage includes vintage motifs, a grain effect, and
                    the fish and butterflies from earlier pages, maintaining visual continuity throughout. For the section dividers, I
                    selected a subtle tab design in a tan hue that echoes the color scheme from previous pages. This choice directs the
                    reader's attention primarily to the student artwork, ensuring that the content remains the focal point while maintaining
                    a consistent and harmonious aesthetic.
