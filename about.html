                <h2>Thank You For Reviewing My Portfolio</h2>
                <!--<p>
                    Hi there! I am currently a Graphic Design student at BYU-Idaho, with a minor in Web Design. My emphasis
                    is in Branding and Identity, but I have also dabbled in UX/UI.
                    I love exploring how design can effectively communicate messages and connect with audiences. My academic
                    journey and work experiences have helped me
                    develop a strong work ethic and attention to detail. Through my experiences working on team projects
                    such as the Outlet Publication, the Flood 50 campaign
                    for the city of Rexburg, and rebranding the College Performing and Visual Arts through my position at
                    BYU-Idaho, I have been able to develop my skills as a collaborative designer.
                </p>-->
                <p>
                    I'm a Graphic Designer with a passion for Branding and Packaging.
                    With knowledge in Web Design and UX/UI, I aspire to create the best brand experience possible by
                    combining all my design knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    I think of myself as a craftsman in all that I do. One of my main creative outlets is crochet, which
                    has
                    helped me to develop a passion for hand making and crafts.
                    I love seeing a project come together, especially from scratch.
                    <br><br>
                    While design absolutely should look good, I believe that design should convey messages that improve
                    the
                    functionality of everyday things.
                    <br><br>
                    An ambition of mine is to someday be involved in designing an escape room experience, combining my
                    love
                    for storytelling, design, and puzzles.
                    I discovered my love for escape rooms at a young age, admiring the pairing of themes, logic, and
                    design
                    to create an immersive experience that creates amazing memories for all who participate.
                    <br><br>
                    I love to learn new things about design and Adobe, especially when it is a trick that can save me
                    hours
                    of work! I love learning from others and always appreciate a chance to find ways to improve my work.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe in doing a job right, no shortcuts.
                    My strong moral compass and dedication to my work comes from my upbringing and my experiences in
                    TaeKwondo, where putting in the work and effort is just as important as the end result.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to crochet and participating in escape rooms, I enjoy playing the piano, reading,
                    playing
                    board games, playing video games, and spending time with my family.
