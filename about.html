                <h2>Thank You For Reviewing My Portfolio</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m a Graphic Designer who loves branding and packaging, and I use my background in web design and
                    UX/UI to build brand experiences that feel thoughtful and genuine.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve always approached design like a craft. Crochet taught me to enjoy slow, hands-on work and to
                    appreciate the moment when everything clicks together. I bring that same mindset to design. It
                    should look good, of course, but it should also make things clearer, easier, and more meaningful.
                    <br><br>
                    I care about doing things the right way. That comes from my upbringing and from TaeKwondo, where
                    effort and consistency matter just as much as the final result.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of design, I’m usually crocheting, solving escape rooms, playing the piano, reading, gaming,
                    or hanging out with my family.
                </p>
                <!--
                <p>
                    I'm a Graphic Designer with a passion for Branding and Packaging.
                    With knowledge in Web Design and UX/UI, I aspire to create the best brand experience possible by
                    combining all my design knowledge and creating compelling stories.
                    <br><br>
                    I think of myself as a craftsman in all that I do. One of my main creative outlets is crochet, which
                    has helped me to develop a passion for hand making and crafts.
                    I love seeing a project come together, especially from scratch.
                    <br><br>
                    While design absolutely should look good, I believe that design should convey messages that improve
                    the functionality of everyday things.
                    <br><br>
                    An ambition of mine is to someday be involved in designing an escape room experience, combining my
                    love
                    for storytelling, design, and puzzles.
                    I discovered my love for escape rooms at a young age, admiring the pairing of themes, logic, and
                    design
                    to create an immersive experience that creates amazing memories for all who participate.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe in doing a job right, no shortcuts.
                    My strong moral compass and dedication to my work comes from my upbringing and my experiences in
                    TaeKwondo, where putting in the work and effort is just as important as the end result.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to crochet and participating in escape rooms, I enjoy playing the piano, reading,
                    playing
                    board games, playing video games, and spending time with my family.
